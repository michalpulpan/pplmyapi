# ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦ pplmyapi (Python PPL myAPI wrapper) 
Czech PPL (Professional Parcel Logistic) API wrapper written in Python. Helps you to communicate with PPL myAPI without worring about fetching access tokens and constructing your own requests. All (hopefully) done for you in the background.

# Install it from PyPI
```bash
pip install pplmyapi
```

## Usage
This is still a work in progress, so the API might change in the future. However, the basic usage is as follows:
1. Create a `PPL` instance with your credentials
2. obtain a `RESTConnector` instance from the `PPL` instance.
3. use the `RESTConnector` instance to communicate with the PPL REST API (myAPI2)
